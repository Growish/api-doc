The Growish API documentation repo
==================================

Make sure you have **apidoc** install in your system, otherwise:

```` 
npm install apidoc -g
````

To build the site use (in root directory):
```` 
apidoc -o docs
````

Test locally by opening **/docs/index.html**, and push when you want to update the public site. A few seconds after the push the modification will be available in [http://growish.github.io/api-doc/](http://growish.github.io/api-doc/)
